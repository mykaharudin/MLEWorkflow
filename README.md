## Data Collection in Machine Learning House PRice

Data collection is the foundation of machine learning. Without relevant and high-quality data, models cannot learn or make accurate predictions.

### Key Points:
- **Accuracy**: Better data, better results.
- **Bias Prevention**: Balanced data avoids bias.
- **Diverse Data**: Varied data improves adaptability.

# Loading Dataset in Machine Learning

Loading a dataset is the first and essential step in the machine learning process. It involves fetching data from external sources and importing it into the working environment for further analysis. Once loaded, you can begin exploring, cleaning, and training your machine learning model, all of which depend on the quality and readiness of the data.
